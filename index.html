            <h4>The 1947 UN Partition Plan & 1948 Arab-Israeli War</h4>
            <p>In 1947, the UN Partition Plan proposed a split between 
              Jewish and Arab nations, shown on the right. 
              However, Israel declared nation state and independence in 1948, 
              and thus began the 1948 Arab - Israeli war which led to the Nakba, 
              or the expulsion of Palestinians from Israeli land. </p>

            <h2>The 1949 Armistice</h2>
            <p>After the war, a 1949 Armistice Line was established. Egypt held control of 
              Gaza and Jordan (controversially) annexed the West Bank. The six-day war in 
              1967 greatly defined the region of Israel and Palestine, as Israel took over 
              the West Bank and Gaza and formally ended Jordan’s control of the West Bank 
              and Egypt’s control of Gaza. This previously defined 1949 Armistice Line 
              became the Green Line as defined by the 1967 war, and what is now recognized 
              as the borders of the Palestinian Territories. </p>

            <h2>2005 Disengagement</h2>
            <p>In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Prior to this disengagement, 
              there were approximately 8,000 Israelis occupying 21 settlements within Gaza. In an agreement 
              between Israelis and Palestinians, the Israeli settlements were razed after the 
              removal of settlers. While this left areas of the densely populated territory open for
               expansion, most Palestinians did not move into this area, in part because of lack of resources 
               to rebuild. Gaza’s economic situation changed rapidly with the 2006 Palestinian elections 
               where Hamas was elected in the majority. Hamas ultimately pushed out Fatah, the other major 
               Palestinian political party, and took complete control of Gaza in 2007, effectively politically 
               splitting Gaza from the West Bank.

          <section data-scene="blockade">
            <h2>Israel's Blockade on Gaza</h2>
            <p>Because of Hamas’ terrorist status, Egypt and Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza 
              via land, air, and ocean, citing security concerns. While Israel continues to 
              directly occupy the West Bank via settlements and military presence, Israel’s 
              blockade of Gaza is considered an indirect occupation of Gaza. As such, both 
              the West Bank and Gaza are considered the occupied Palestinian territories
              within international literature. In Gaza, the Green Line transitioned into a
              border with a security fence and later a wall. This border barrier is a physical 
              restriction on land travel with a buffer zone inside of Gaza parallel to the border 
              where Gazans are restricted from entering. In parts, this barrier is now a wall 
              extending deep into the ground to prevent tunneling by Palestinians attempting to 
              develop a black market system of gathering resources restricted by Israel. Border 
              crossings along this barrier have been closed through the blockade and at various 
              points of conflict prior to the blockade. Currently, there are two crossings open: 
              Erez in the north, which allows humanitarian aid workers, some Palestinian workers, 
              and others with medical emergencies to cross, and Kerem Shalom in the south. Kerem 
              Shalom permits the transfer of a limited number of goods into Gaza. This blockade 
              has restricted exports from Gaza, severely stinting any possible economic growth 
              and restricted imports of materials that could be used to help repair damaged 
              infrastructure from acute violence events by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF).
