# Gaza Under Occupation

This story map traces the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
and focuses on Gaza, specifically through the 2005 disengagement and
subsequent blockade. While peace has not been achieved, progress toward
the peace process has occurred. The final story map scene questions 
whether or not peace is possible. 

### Goal:
This story map is intended to help understand Gaza's landscape and how Israel's blockade and occupation and Hamas' leadership has shaped Gaza's border, history, and current status.

### Techical Summary:

#### 1. System Architecture
This is a story map hosted on my personal GitHub server. I have employed Leaflet as my JavaScript library for developing my map. 
#### 2. Main Functions
There are a variety of functions included in my story map. Some simple functions include the use of a video for the introduction page, the onClick function to label the Gaza crossing points, and a Leaflet slider to view side-by-side maps. 

### Libraries
Various Leaflet functions, GitHub, Bootstrap, Google Maps, jQuery, Font Awesome, and Google Font are all used in this story map.
