# Gaza Under Occupation

This storymap traces the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
and focuses on Gaza, specifically through the 2005 disengagement and
subsequent blockade. While peace has not been achieved, progress toward
the peace process has occurred. The final story map scene questions 
whether or not peace is possible. 

Thanks to B'tselem for providing geospatial data for this project.
